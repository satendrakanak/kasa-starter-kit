# Code With Kasa - Server

This is the backend application of **Code With Kasa**, a full-stack Learning Management System built with **NestJS**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **PostgreSQL**.

The server handles authentication, authorization, users, courses, lessons, orders, coupons, refunds, exams, progress tracking, roles, permissions, logs, and complete LMS business logic.

---

## Backend Overview

The backend follows a modular NestJS architecture. Each major feature is managed using dedicated modules, controllers, services, DTOs, guards, and business logic layers.

It provides REST APIs for the frontend client and powers the complete LMS platform.

- Keep modules clean and separated.
- Keep DTOs and validations organized.
- Keep guards and role checks properly applied.
- Keep database credentials private.
- Use `.env.example` for public reference.
- Keep business logic inside services.
- Keep route handlers clean inside controllers.
