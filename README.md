# Kasa Enterprise

**Kasa Enterprise** is a complete full-stack Learning Management System built with **Next.js**, **NestJS**, and **PostgreSQL**.

It is designed as a production-style LMS platform with separate role-based dashboards for **Admin**, **Faculty**, and **Students**. The system includes course management, course purchases, coupons, orders, learning progress, exams, reviews, articles, permissions, role management, contact leads, testimonials, email templates, logs, and complete platform settings.

## Docker Quick Start

Fresh clone flow:

```bash
./scripts/register-kasa-command.sh
kasa install dev
```

Then open:

- Installer: http://localhost:3000/install
- Client: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger: http://localhost:8000/api

The first run opens the installation wizard. It checks the database, asks for
academy details, activates the license key through the Kasa Licence Portal,
creates the first admin user, and can import the demo data with a live progress
bar.

For local testing, run the Kasa Licence Portal on port `5000`, generate a
`kasa-enterprise` key there, and keep `LICENSE_PORTAL_URL=http://localhost:5000`.
When Kasa Enterprise runs in Docker, it automatically routes that localhost URL
to the host machine internally.

Database name is configurable in `.env.docker` through `POSTGRES_DB`. On a new
Docker volume, PostgreSQL creates that database automatically.

Local PostgreSQL is exposed on host port `5433` by default so it does not clash
with Postgres already running on your machine. The app containers still connect
to Postgres on container port `5432`.

Short commands:

```bash
kasa install dev
kasa install dev -r
kasa install app
kasa start dev
kasa start app
kasa stop
kasa restart dev

make install-dev
make install-app
make dev
make dev-down

make prod
make prod-down
```

What they do:

- `kasa install dev`: creates `.env.docker` if needed, starts the development stack, and prints setup URLs.
- `kasa install dev -r`: stops the development stack, resets the bundled Docker database, backs up the current `.env.docker`, recreates `.env.docker` from `.env.docker.example`, then starts a fresh installer.
- `kasa install app`: creates `.env.production.local` if needed, starts the local production-test stack, and prints setup URLs.
- `kasa start dev`: starts an already-installed development stack without resetting setup.
- `kasa start app`: starts an already-installed local production-test stack without resetting setup.
- `kasa stop`: stops both development and local production-test stacks so ports are free.
- `kasa restart dev`: stops and starts the development stack without reinstalling.
- `kasa restart app`: stops and starts the local production-test stack without reinstalling.
- `make install-dev`: creates `.env.docker` if needed, starts the development stack, and prints setup URLs.
- `make install-app`: creates `.env.production.local` if needed, starts the local production-test stack, and prints setup URLs.
- `make dev`: starts the development Docker stack with hot reload.
- `make prod`: builds and starts the local production Docker stack for final testing.

Raw Docker command:

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
docker compose --env-file .env.docker up --build
```

Full infrastructure and CI/CD notes are in [docs/INFRA_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/INFRA_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md).
AWS S3 and CloudFront setup notes are in [docs/AWS_STORAGE_SETUP.md](./docs/AWS_STORAGE_SETUP.md).

Database setup during installation:

- Choose **bundled database** for the default Docker Postgres setup.
- Choose **external PostgreSQL** for localhost Postgres, a private database server, or Amazon RDS.
- For external databases, create the empty database first, then enter host, port, database name, username, password, and SSL preference in the installer.
- After saving an external database, restart the stack with `kasa restart dev` or `kasa restart app`, then reopen `/install` and continue.

The selected external database is stored locally in `.kasa/database.json`. This file is ignored by Git and should not be committed.

Install vs start:

- Use `kasa install dev` or `kasa install app` only for first setup or when creating env files.
- Use `kasa start dev` or `kasa start app` after setup is already complete.
- Use `kasa restart dev` or `kasa restart app` after changing database mode in the installer.
- Use `kasa stop` before switching between dev and local production-test stacks.
